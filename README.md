[Smalltalkhub](http://smalltalkhub.com/) "is now getting old and unmaintained so this is time to deprecate it. \[...\] If you currently host a project in SmalltalkHub, you should migrate your projects to another platform as soon as possible. If you depend on a project hosted on SmalltalkHub, you should contact the owner of that project to schedule a migration. If you have documentation or tutorials using SmalltalkHub, we recommend to update those after a migration."

This README serves as a tracker for projects migrated out of Smalltalkhub. Feel free to fork, update and send PR.
